# Per-Connection State Management Investigation

**Date:** 2025-12-13
**Objective:** Investigate ADK recommended patterns for per-user/per-connection state management in Agent definitions
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress

---

## Background

### Current Problem

We discovered that `FrontendToolDelegate` is a global singleton shared across all WebSocket connections:

```python
# server.py:88 - Global instance (shared by all users)
frontend_delegate = FrontendToolDelegate()

# server.py:407-409 - All connections use the same tools
tools=[get_weather, calculate, get_current_time, change_bgm, get_location],
```

**Issues:**
1. `_pending_calls` dict is shared across all users
2. Tools (change_bgm, get_location) reference the global delegate
3. Memory leak risk when users disconnect without completing tool calls
4. Poor isolation between users

### What We Need

**Per-Connection State:**
- Each WebSocket connection needs its own `FrontendToolDelegate` instance
- Tools need to use the connection-specific delegate

**Question:**
How does ADK recommend handling per-user or per-connection state in Agent definitions?

---

## Investigation Plan

1. ✅ Review ADK documentation for state management patterns
2. ⏭️ Search for session/user context in ADK Agent API
3. ⏭️ Investigate Tool definition patterns with dynamic state
4. ⏭️ Check if ADK has dependency injection or context passing mechanisms
5. ⏭️ Review ADK examples for multi-user scenarios

---

## Investigation Results

### 1. ADK Documentation Review

**Sources:**
- https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/state/
- https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools-custom/

**Key Findings:**

#### Sessions & State

ADK provides **Session** as the primary abstraction for per-user conversations:
- `session.state`: Key-value scratchpad for conversation-specific data
- State scopes via prefixes:
  - No prefix: Session-specific
  - `user:*`: Shared across all sessions for a user
  - `app:*`: Shared globally across the application
  - `temp:*`: Invocation-only, discarded after completion

#### ToolContext Pattern

Tools access session-specific resources through **implicit context passing**:

```python
def update_user_preference(preference: str, value: str, tool_context: ToolContext):
    """Tools receive ToolContext automatically."""
    # Access session state
    tool_context.state['user:preference'] = value

    # Control agent flow
    tool_context.actions.transfer_to_agent = "other_agent"

    # Access artifacts and memory
    tool_context.load_artifact(name)
    tool_context.search_memory(query)
```

**ToolContext Features:**
- `.state`: Session/user/app state access
- `.actions`: Control agent behavior (transfer, etc.)
- `.load_artifact()`, `.save_artifact()`: File management
- `.search_memory()`: Long-term memory queries

#### Per-Connection Resources: No Standard Pattern

**Critical Finding:** ADK documentation does **NOT** provide explicit patterns for connection-specific resources (e.g., WebSocket delegate objects).

**Suggested Approaches (from docs):**
1. Store in session state with connection identifiers
2. Use a service layer injected via Runner configuration
3. Manage lifecycle separately from tool invocation

**Quote from docs:**
> "Tools are stateless functions... ToolContext provides session and user-level state management but not connection-specific resource handling."

---

## Analysis: Applying ADK Patterns to Our Problem

### Our Specific Case

**Problem:**
```python
# Current: Global delegate (shared across all connections)
frontend_delegate = FrontendToolDelegate()

async def change_bgm(track: int, tool_context: ToolContext):
    # Uses global frontend_delegate ❌
    result = await frontend_delegate.execute_on_frontend(...)
```

**Requirements:**
- Each WebSocket connection needs its own `FrontendToolDelegate` instance
- Tools need access to the connection-specific delegate
- Delegate contains `asyncio.Future` objects (not serializable)

### Evaluated Approaches

#### Option 1: ToolContext.state with temp: prefix ⚠️

```python
# In WebSocket handler
session.state['temp:frontend_delegate'] = FrontendToolDelegate()

# In tool
async def change_bgm(track: int, tool_context: ToolContext):
    delegate = tool_context.state.get('temp:frontend_delegate')
    result = await delegate.execute_on_frontend(...)
```

**Pros:**
- Uses ADK's state mechanism
- `temp:` prefix means not persisted (OK for Python objects)

**Cons:**
- ToolContext.state references Session.state
- Multiple WebSocket connections might share the same Session
- Race condition: Connection A and B with same user_id would overwrite each other's delegate

#### Option 2: Connection-scoped tools with closure (✅ RECOMMENDED)

```python
# In WebSocket handler
def build_connection_tools(delegate: FrontendToolDelegate) -> list[Tool]:
    """Build tools that capture connection-specific delegate."""

    async def change_bgm(track: int, tool_context: ToolContext):
        # Uses the delegate from closure ✅
        result = await delegate.execute_on_frontend(
            tool_call_id=tool_context.function_call_id,
            tool_name="change_bgm",
            args={"track": track}
        )
        return result

    async def get_location(tool_context: ToolContext):
        # Uses the delegate from closure ✅
        result = await delegate.execute_on_frontend(...)
        return result

    return [
        Tool(change_bgm, ...),
        Tool(get_location, ...),
    ]

# Per-connection initialization
connection_delegate = FrontendToolDelegate()
connection_tools = build_connection_tools(connection_delegate)
# Use these tools for this connection's agent runner
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Each connection has isolated delegate
- ✅ Tools are stateless (ADK principle)
- ✅ Delegate is captured via closure (clean Python pattern)
- ✅ No global state
- ✅ Automatic cleanup when connection ends

**Cons:**
- Need to rebuild tools per-connection (minor overhead)
- Agent definition needs to accept tools dynamically

#### Option 3: Global dict with connection_id mapping

```python
# Global mapping
_connection_delegates: dict[str, FrontendToolDelegate] = {}

# In WebSocket handler
connection_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
_connection_delegates[connection_id] = FrontendToolDelegate()
session.state['temp:connection_id'] = connection_id

# In tool
async def change_bgm(track: int, tool_context: ToolContext):
    connection_id = tool_context.state.get('temp:connection_id')
    delegate = _connection_delegates[connection_id]
    result = await delegate.execute_on_frontend(...)
```

**Pros:**
- Works with global tool definitions

**Cons:**
- ❌ Manual cleanup required (memory leak risk)
- ❌ More complex error handling
- ❌ Global mutable state

---

## Re-evaluation: ToolContext.state Approach

**User's important observation:**
> ADK documentation shows `tool_context.state` with `temp:` prefix for temporary data.
> Could we store delegate in `tool_context.state['temp:frontend_delegate']` instead?

This warrants re-evaluation of our approach.

### Approach Comparison: Closure vs ToolContext.state

#### Approach A: Closure Pattern (Currently Implemented)

```python
# In WebSocket handler
def build_connection_tools(delegate: FrontendToolDelegate) -> list:
    async def change_bgm(track: int, tool_context: ToolContext):
        # Uses delegate from closure ✅
        result = await delegate.execute_on_frontend(...)
    return [change_bgm, get_location]

connection_delegate = FrontendToolDelegate()
connection_tools = build_connection_tools(connection_delegate)
all_tools = [get_weather, calculate, get_current_time] + connection_tools

# Create per-connection agent
connection_agent = Agent(tools=all_tools)
connection_runner = InMemoryRunner(agent=connection_agent)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Each connection has isolated delegate (closure captures it)
- ✅ No shared state between connections
- ✅ Type-safe (delegate is Python object, not in dict)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup when connection ends
- ✅ Clear ownership: delegate belongs to this connection

**Cons:**
- ❌ Must create new Agent per-connection (overhead)
- ❌ Must create new Runner per-connection (overhead)
- ❌ Cannot reuse global Agent definition
- ❌ More complex initialization

#### Approach B: ToolContext.state Pattern (ADK Native)

```python
# In WebSocket handler
session = await get_or_create_session(user_id, bidi_agent_runner, "agents")
session.state['temp:frontend_delegate'] = FrontendToolDelegate()

# In tool (global definition - no rebuild needed)
async def change_bgm(track: int, tool_context: ToolContext):
    delegate = tool_context.state.get('temp:frontend_delegate')
    if not delegate:
        return {"success": False, "error": "Delegate not initialized"}
    result = await delegate.execute_on_frontend(...)
    return result

# Use global agent (no per-connection agent needed)
bidi_agent = Agent(
    tools=[get_weather, calculate, get_current_time, change_bgm, get_location]
)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Uses ADK's recommended pattern (ToolContext.state)
- ✅ Can reuse global Agent definition
- ✅ Can reuse global Runner
- ✅ Simpler initialization (no per-connection agent)
- ✅ More ADK-idiomatic
- ✅ `temp:` prefix = not persisted (perfect for Python objects)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Session may be shared across WebSocket connections!
  - If user opens 2 tabs → 2 WebSocket connections
  - Both use same `user_id` → same Session
  - `session.state['temp:frontend_delegate']` would be overwritten
  - Connection 1's delegate replaced by Connection 2's delegate
- ❌ Potential race condition in multi-connection scenarios
- ⚠️ Less explicit ownership (delegate in state dict)

### Critical Question: Session Scope

**Key Investigation Needed:**

```python
# server.py:652, 757
session = await get_or_create_session(user_id, bidi_agent_runner, "agents")
```

**Question:** Is Session per-user or per-connection?

**Current implementation (server.py:484-499):**
```python
async def get_or_create_session(user_id, agent_runner, app_name):
    session_id = f"session_{user_id}_{app_name}"
    if session_id not in _sessions:
        _sessions[session_id] = await agent_runner.create_session(...)
    return _sessions[session_id]
```

**Analysis:**
- Session ID = `f"session_{user_id}_{app_name}"`
- **NO connection_id component!**
- Same `user_id` → same Session across connections
- ❌ **Multiple WebSocket connections share the same Session**

**Implication:**
- Approach B (ToolContext.state) would fail with multiple connections
- `session.state['temp:frontend_delegate']` would be overwritten
- Connection 1 and Connection 2 interfere with each other

### Possible Solutions for Approach B

#### Solution B1: Add connection_id to Session

```python
import uuid

async def get_or_create_session(user_id, agent_runner, app_name, connection_id=None):
    if connection_id is None:
        connection_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    session_id = f"session_{user_id}_{app_name}_{connection_id}"
    ...
```

**Problem:** Breaks session continuity. Each connection = new session (loses history).

#### Solution B2: Use connection_id in state key

```python
# In WebSocket handler
connection_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
session.state[f'temp:frontend_delegate_{connection_id}'] = delegate
session.state['temp:current_connection_id'] = connection_id

# In tool
async def change_bgm(track: int, tool_context: ToolContext):
    connection_id = tool_context.state.get('temp:current_connection_id')
    delegate = tool_context.state.get(f'temp:frontend_delegate_{connection_id}')
```

**Problem:** Complex, error-prone. Must manage connection_id lifecycle.

## Final Recommendation

### Analysis Summary

| Aspect | Approach A (Closure) | Approach B (ToolContext.state) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| ADK idiomatic | ⚠️ Uses closure (Python idiom) | ✅ Uses recommended ToolContext.state |
| Multi-connection safety | ✅ Isolated per-connection | ❌ Shared session conflicts |
| Complexity | ❌ Per-connection Agent/Runner | ✅ Reuses global Agent/Runner |
| Type safety | ✅ Python object in closure | ⚠️ Object in dict (runtime check) |
| Cleanup | ✅ Automatic (GC) | ⚠️ Manual cleanup needed |

### Recommendation: **Hybrid Approach**

**Use Approach A (Closure) for now, but document why:**

**Rationale:**
1. **Session sharing is a blocker** for Approach B in current architecture
2. Current `get_or_create_session()` creates one session per user, not per connection
3. Multiple connections from same user would conflict
4. Fixing session management is a larger architectural change

**Future Direction:**
Once ADK session architecture is clarified (per-connection vs per-user), we can:
- Option 1: Use ToolContext.state if sessions become per-connection
- Option 2: Implement Solution B2 (connection_id in state keys)
- Option 3: Keep closure approach as the simpler solution

### Implementation Decision

**PENDING - Need deeper investigation of ADK state prefix implementation**

Before making final decision, we need to understand:
1. How ADK implements state prefix scoping (temp:, user:, app:)
2. When/how state is persisted vs discarded
3. Relationship between Session scope and state prefixes
4. Whether temp: state is truly per-invocation or per-session

---

## Deep Dive: ADK State Prefix Implementation

**Investigation Goal:** Understand ADK's state prefix implementation at the code level.

**Questions:**
1. How does ADK distinguish `temp:`, `user:`, `app:` prefixes?
2. What preprocessing/postprocessing happens for each prefix?
3. Is `temp:` state cleared per-invocation or per-session?
4. Can `temp:` state span multiple tool calls within same session?
5. What happens to `temp:` state across WebSocket reconnections?

### Investigation Plan

1. ✅ Search ADK documentation for state prefix behavior
2. ✅ Search ADK GitHub repository for state implementation
3. ✅ Look for state persistence/cleanup logic
4. ⏭️ Examine Session lifecycle and state scoping
5. ⏭️ Test actual behavior with temporary state

### Source Code Analysis (google/adk-python)

**Source:** DeepWiki search on `google/adk-python` repository

#### 1. State Prefix Processing (`_session_util.py`)

**Function:** `extract_state_delta(state_dict)`

```python
# Separates state changes by prefix:
- app: prefixed keys → extracted to "app" delta (persisted to StorageAppState)
- user: prefixed keys → extracted to "user" delta (persisted to StorageUserState)
- temp: prefixed keys → NOT included in any delta (not persisted)
- No prefix → extracted to "session" delta (persisted per-session)
```

**Key Constants:**
```python
State.APP_PREFIX = "app:"
State.USER_PREFIX = "user:"
State.TEMP_PREFIX = "temp:"
```

#### 2. Clearing temp: State (`BaseSessionService`)

**Method:** `_trim_temp_delta_state(state_delta)`

**Behavior:**
- Called **before** persisting events to storage
- Filters out all `temp:` prefixed keys from `state_delta`
- Used in: `DatabaseSessionService`, `SqliteSessionService`

**Code Flow:**
```python
# In append_event():
state_delta = event.actions.state_delta
state_delta = _trim_temp_delta_state(state_delta)  # Remove temp: keys
# Then persist to database (temp: keys not saved)
```

**Important Discovery:** `temp:` state is **NOT cleared per-invocation**. It exists in the Session's runtime state but is simply not persisted to storage.

#### 3. Persistence of user: and app: State

**DatabaseSessionService:**
```python
# create_session():
app_state_delta, user_state_delta, session_state_delta = extract_state_delta(initial_state)
# Update StorageAppState table (app:*)
# Update StorageUserState table (user:*)
# Commit to database

# append_event():
app_state_delta, user_state_delta, _ = extract_state_delta(event.state_delta)
# Update storage_app_state
# Update storage_user_state
# Commit to database
```

**InMemorySessionService:**
```python
# In-memory storage:
self.app_state = {}     # Keyed by app_name
self.user_state = {}    # Keyed by (app_name, user_id)

# _create_session_impl():
app_state_delta, user_state_delta, _ = extract_state_delta(initial_state)
self.app_state[app_name].update(app_state_delta)
self.user_state[(app_name, user_id)].update(user_state_delta)
```

#### 4. State Merging (`_merge_state`)

**Purpose:** Combine app, user, and session state into single `session.state` dict

**Process:**
```python
def _merge_state(app_state, user_state, session_state):
    merged = {}
    # Add app state with app: prefix
    for key, value in app_state.items():
        merged[f"app:{key}"] = value
    # Add user state with user: prefix
    for key, value in user_state.items():
        merged[f"user:{key}"] = value
    # Add session state (no prefix)
    merged.update(session_state)
    return merged

# In get_session():
session.state = _merge_state(app_state, user_state, session_state)
```

**Result:** `session.state` contains all three scopes in one dict with appropriate prefixes

### Critical Findings

#### Finding 1: temp: State Scope

**Scope:** Per-Session (NOT per-invocation)

**Lifecycle:**
1. Set via `tool_context.state['temp:key'] = value` during tool execution
2. Exists in Session's runtime state dictionary
3. **NOT persisted** when `append_event()` is called (filtered by `_trim_temp_delta_state`)
4. Remains in Session state for subsequent tool calls in same session
5. **Lost** when Session is destroyed or reloaded from storage

**Example:**
```python
# Tool Call 1
tool_context.state['temp:delegate'] = FrontendToolDelegate()

# Tool Call 2 (same session)
delegate = tool_context.state.get('temp:delegate')  # ✅ Still exists!

# After session reload from DB
delegate = tool_context.state.get('temp:delegate')  # ❌ Gone (not persisted)
```

#### Finding 2: State Persistence Timing

**When state is persisted:**
- After each `append_event()` call
- During `create_session()` for initial state
- Not continuously (state exists in memory between events)

**What gets persisted:**
- ✅ `app:*` keys → StorageAppState table
- ✅ `user:*` keys → StorageUserState table
- ✅ No-prefix keys → Session's state field
- ❌ `temp:*` keys → Discarded before persistence

#### Finding 3: Multi-Connection Scenario

**Current Architecture:**
```python
session_id = f"session_{user_id}_{app_name}"  # No connection_id!
```

**Implication for temp: state:**
```
User opens 2 tabs:
- Tab 1 WebSocket → Same Session → state['temp:delegate'] = Delegate_A
- Tab 2 WebSocket → Same Session → state['temp:delegate'] = Delegate_B (overwrites!)

Problem: Both connections share same Session state (including temp:*)
```

**Conclusion:** `temp:` prefix does NOT solve the multi-connection issue because temp: state is still Session-scoped, and multiple WebSocket connections share the same Session.

---

## Final Decision: Approach A (Closure Pattern)

### Investigation Summary

After deep dive into ADK source code implementation, we discovered:

1. **temp: state is Session-scoped**, not invocation-scoped
   - Persists across multiple tool calls in same session
   - Only difference: not persisted to storage (lost on reload)

2. **Current session architecture is per-user**, not per-connection
   - `session_id = f"session_{user_id}_{app_name}"`
   - Multiple WebSocket connections from same user share the same Session

3. **temp: state would be shared across connections**
   - Tab 1 and Tab 2 from same user → same Session → same temp: state
   - Connection-specific delegate in temp: state would be overwritten

### Why Approach B (ToolContext.state) Fails

```python
# Approach B implementation:
session.state['temp:frontend_delegate'] = FrontendToolDelegate()

# Problem scenario:
User opens Tab 1:
  WebSocket 1 → Session(user_id="alice") → state['temp:delegate'] = Delegate_A

User opens Tab 2:
  WebSocket 2 → Session(user_id="alice") → state['temp:delegate'] = Delegate_B  # Overwrites!

Result: Both connections use Delegate_B (wrong!)
```

**Root cause:** Session is per-user, but we need per-connection isolation.

### Why Approach A (Closure) Works

```python
# Approach A implementation:
def build_connection_tools(delegate: FrontendToolDelegate):
    async def change_bgm(track: int, tool_context: ToolContext):
        result = await delegate.execute_on_frontend(...)  # Uses closure delegate
    return [change_bgm, get_location]

# Each connection:
connection_delegate = FrontendToolDelegate()  # Unique per connection
connection_tools = build_connection_tools(connection_delegate)  # Captures delegate
connection_agent = Agent(tools=all_tools)
```

**Isolation mechanism:** Python closure captures connection-specific delegate at function creation time.

### Implementation Decision

**✅ Use Approach A: Connection-scoped tools with closure**

**Required changes:**
1. Create `build_connection_tools(delegate)` function ✅ (Already done)
2. In WebSocket handler:
   - Create per-connection `FrontendToolDelegate` ✅ (Already done)
   - Build connection tools with closure
   - Combine with global tools (get_weather, calculate, get_current_time)
   - Create per-connection Agent with combined tools
   - Create per-connection Runner
   - Use connection-specific runner instead of global

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- ❌ Cannot reuse global Agent (must create per-connection)
- ❌ Cannot reuse global Runner (must create per-connection)
- ✅ Correct isolation between connections
- ✅ Type-safe delegate handling
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on connection close

### Alternative Considered: Make Session Per-Connection

**Option:** Change session architecture to be per-connection

```python
async def get_or_create_session(user_id, agent_runner, app_name, connection_id):
    session_id = f"session_{user_id}_{app_name}_{connection_id}"
    ...
```

**Rejected because:**
- ❌ Breaks conversation history continuity across reconnections
- ❌ User loses context when switching tabs
- ❌ Requires major architectural change to session management
- ❌ Not aligned with ADK's design (sessions are meant to persist)

### Next Steps

1. ⏭️ Implement per-connection Agent creation in WebSocket handler
2. ⏭️ Test with multiple concurrent connections
3. ⏭️ Verify tools use correct delegate per connection
4. ⏭️ Document the pattern for future reference

## Re-evaluation: Connection Identifier and Multi-Device Scenarios

**Date:** 2025-12-13 (continued discussion)

### Background: Reconsidering the Problem Space

Before implementing the closure pattern (Approach A), we paused to discuss fundamental concepts and requirements.

### Concept Alignment: User, Connection, Session, Delegate

#### 1. User
- **Definition:** A person using the system
- **Identifier:** `user_id` (e.g., "alice", "bob")
- **Characteristics:**
  - Can have multiple devices (PC, iPhone, Android)
  - Can open multiple browser tabs
  - Has conversation history

#### 2. WebSocket Connection
- **Definition:** Physical communication channel between browser/device and server
- **Identifier:** **Currently missing!** (only WebSocket instance)
- **Characteristics:**
  - 1 tab/device = 1 connection
  - Can disconnect/reconnect
  - Bidirectional communication

#### 3. Session (ADK Session)
- **Definition:** Conversation context managed by ADK
- **Identifier:** `session_id = f"session_{user_id}_{app_name}"`
- **Characteristics:**
  - Holds conversation history
  - Has state (`app:`, `user:`, `temp:`, no-prefix)
  - **Current design:** Per-user (shared across connections)

#### 4. FrontendToolDelegate
- **Definition:** Object that mediates frontend tool execution
- **Role:**
  - Send tool calls to frontend
  - Wait for results (`asyncio.Future`)
  - Manage `_pending_calls` state
- **Scope:** **To be determined**

### Critical Insight: Multi-Device Scenario

**User's important observation:**

> When considering not just tabs but different devices (PC, iPhone, Android), the device that **initiated the interaction** should be the one receiving the tool approval request.

**Example Scenario:**
```
User Alice has 3 active connections:
├─ PC (WebSocket 1) → Sends message → Tool call triggered
├─ iPhone (WebSocket 2) → Idle
└─ Android (WebSocket 3) → Idle

Tool approval request should go to: PC (WebSocket 1)
```

**Rationale:**
- The user is actively using that specific device
- Other devices shouldn't randomly show approval dialogs
- Context is on the device where conversation is happening

### Future Extension: Remote Device Control

**Potential use case:**
- User on PC starts conversation
- Tool requires mobile-specific permission (e.g., location)
- System could route approval request to user's iPhone

**Requirement:** Ability to manage and route between multiple connections for same user.

### The Missing Piece: Connection Identifier

**Current problem:**
```python
@app.websocket("/api/chat/bidi")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    # No connection_id!
    # No way to identify which connection tool call came from
```

**What we need:**
```python
# Generate unique identifier for each connection
connection_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

# Track multiple connections per user
user_connections[user_id] = [
    {"connection_id": "conn_1", "device": "PC", "websocket": ws_1},
    {"connection_id": "conn_2", "device": "iPhone", "websocket": ws_2},
    {"connection_id": "conn_3", "device": "Android", "websocket": ws_3},
]

# When tool call occurs:
# 1. Record source_connection_id
# 2. Route approval request to same connection
# 3. (Future) Support routing to different connection
```

### Critical Question: Is This a Solved Problem?

**User's key insight:**

> This problem (connection management, multi-device support) can't be unique to us. ADK and AI SDK v6 must have encountered this. There should be:
> - Official documentation
> - Reference implementations
> - GitHub issues/PRs discussing this
> - Recommended patterns

**Why this matters:**
- We shouldn't reinvent the wheel
- Official patterns are likely more robust
- Community discussion provides valuable context
- Avoids known pitfalls

### Investigation Results

**Investigation Date:** 2025-12-13

#### Finding 1: ADK Discussion #2784 - Multi-Client WebSocket Architecture

**Source:** [GitHub Discussion #2784](https://github.com/google/adk-python/discussions/2784)

**Topic:** "Self-hosting ADK agent over websocket server with multiple clients"

**Key Recommendations:**

1. **Unique session per client connection**
   - Each client connection should map to a unique session identified by `userID`
   - Maintain separate agent runner instances per connection

2. **Use `tool_context.state` for connection-specific data**
   ```python
   from adk.context import ToolContext
   from adk.tools import tool

   @tool
   def my_tool(query: str, tool_context: ToolContext):
       client_id = tool_context.state.get("client_id")
       # Route commands to appropriate WebSocket connection
   ```

3. **Production scaling considerations**
   - Default `InMemorySessionService` only works for single-instance deployments
   - For multiple instances: Use distributed session store (Redis, database)
   - Run behind load balancer

**Analysis:**
- This aligns with **Approach B (ToolContext.state)**
- Suggests storing `client_id` in session state for routing
- However, **unclear** if "unique session per client" means:
  - Option A: Different `session_id` per connection (new session for each tab)
  - Option B: Same session for same user, but store `client_id` in state for routing

#### Finding 2: ADK bidi-demo Implementation Pattern

**Source:** DeepWiki analysis of `google/adk-python` repository

**File:** `src/google/adk/cli/adk_web_server.py` (`run_agent_live` endpoint)

**Implementation Details:**

1. **No explicit connection ID tracking**
   - Uses `(app_name, user_id, session_id)` combination for context identification
   - WebSocket connection instance itself is not assigned an ID

2. **Per-connection task management**
   ```python
   # Each WebSocket connection spawns two tasks:
   forward_events: runner.run_live() → Send events to client
   process_messages: Receive messages from client → LiveRequestQueue
   ```

3. **Concurrent connection handling**
   - FastAPI + asyncio manage multiple connections
   - Each connection has independent `session` and `LiveRequestQueue`

4. **Session retrieval**
   ```python
   # On WebSocket connection:
   session = get_session(app_name, user_id, session_id)
   if not session:
       close connection
   ```

**Analysis:**
- **Contradiction with Discussion #2784?**
  - Discussion says "unique session per client"
  - bidi-demo doesn't track connection IDs
  - How does same user with multiple tabs work?

**Unanswered Questions:**
- What happens if same `user_id` + `session_id` used from 2 tabs?
- Do they share the same Session instance?
- If so, how are tool calls routed to the correct connection?

#### Finding 3: AI SDK v6 WebSocket Support Status

**Source:** [GitHub Discussion #5607](https://github.com/vercel/ai/discussions/5607)

**Status:** WebSocket native support **not yet implemented** (planned feature)

**Current Options:**
- Custom transports supported since AI SDK 5
- Developers can implement own WebSocket solutions

**Challenges Identified:**
- Scaling and load balancing
- Authentication during HTTP handshake
- **Stateful connection management** ← Our problem
- **Multi-tab/multi-device coordination** ← Our problem!

**Key Insight:**
- AI SDK team recognizes "multi-tab/multi-device coordination" as a challenge
- No official solution provided yet (native support still in development)
- Community relies on custom implementations

#### Finding 4: AI SDK v6 Transport System

**Source:** [AI SDK UI Transport Documentation](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/transport)

**Features:**
- Custom `ChatTransport` interface for alternative protocols
- Dynamic configuration (auth tokens, user ID, session ID)
- Request/Response transformation

**Example:**
```javascript
const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({
  transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
    headers: () => ({
      'X-User-ID': getCurrentUserId(),
      'X-Session-ID': getCurrentSessionId(),
    }),
  }),
});
```

**Analysis:**
- Supports sending `user_id` and `session_id` in headers
- **No mention of connection ID**
- Transport layer doesn't address multi-connection routing

### Summary of Findings

#### What We Learned

1. **ADK Community Recommendation (Discussion #2784)**
   - Store connection identifier in `tool_context.state`
   - Use this for routing tool calls to correct connection
   - ✅ Validates Approach B (ToolContext.state)

2. **ADK Official Implementation (bidi-demo)**
   - Does NOT explicitly track connection IDs
   - Unclear how multi-connection scenarios are handled
   - ⚠️ Contradicts Discussion #2784?

3. **AI SDK v6 Status**
   - Multi-tab/multi-device coordination is a **known challenge**
   - No official solution provided
   - Custom implementations required

4. **Key Gap in Understanding**
   - How does bidi-demo handle same user with multiple tabs?
   - What is the actual session lifecycle in multi-connection scenarios?
   - Is connection tracking truly unnecessary, or missing from the example?

### Critical Questions Remaining

1. **Session Scope in Practice**
   - If same `(user_id, session_id)` used from 2 tabs, do they share Session?
   - If shared, how do we route tool approval requests to the correct tab?

2. **Connection Identifier Pattern**
   - Should we generate `connection_id` on backend or frontend?
   - Where should it be stored (`tool_context.state`? separate registry?)
   - How to clean up when connection closes?

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Follow Discussion #2784 recommendation (store client_id in state)?
   - Or implement explicit connection tracking (our current approach)?
   - Or hybrid approach?

### Next Investigation Steps

1. ⏭️ Test ADK bidi-demo with multiple tabs from same browser
2. ⏭️ Search ADK GitHub for issues about "multiple tabs" or "concurrent connections"
3. ⏭️ Review ADK source code for Session lifecycle management
4. ✅ Check if `LiveRequestQueue` is connection-specific or session-specific
5. ✅ Investigate how `runner.run_live()` handles multiple concurrent calls with same session

---

#### Finding 5: LiveRequestQueue Implementation and Scope

**Source:** DeepWiki analysis of `google/adk-python` repository

**File:** `src/google/adk/live_request_queue.py`

**Implementation:**

```python
class LiveRequestQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self._queue = asyncio.Queue()

    def close(self):
        self._queue.put_nowait(LiveRequest(close=True))

    def send_content(self, content: types.Content):
        self._queue.put_nowait(LiveRequest(content=content))

    async def get(self) -> LiveRequest:
        return await self._queue.get()
```

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Connection-specific (接続固有)**
   - 各WebSocket connectionごとに新しいインスタンス作成
   - `asyncio.Queue`のラッパー
   - 複数のconnectionで共有されない

2. **Lifecycle (ライフサイクル)**
   - 1つのlive agent invocationに紐付く
   - `/run_live` WebSocket endpoint接続時に作成
   - `runner.run_live()`に渡される
   - 接続終了時にclose

3. **Scope (スコープ)**
   - 同じinvocation内の複数streaming toolsで共有可能
   - 異なるconnectionでは共有されない

**Analysis:**
- ✅ LiveRequestQueueは完全にconnection-specific
- ✅ 各connectionが独自のqueueを持つ
- ⚠️ しかし、複数connectionで同じSessionを使うとどうなる？

---

#### Finding 6: Critical Discovery - Concurrent run_live() with Same Session

**Source:** DeepWiki analysis of `runner.run_live()` implementation

**File:** `src/google/adk/runners.py`

**Critical Question:** Can `runner.run_live()` be called multiple times concurrently with the same session object?

**Answer: NO - Race Conditions Occur!**

**What Happens:**

1. **Session Retrieval (同じSessionオブジェクト取得)**
   ```python
   # Tab 1 WebSocket
   session = await session_service.get_session(app_name, user_id, session_id)

   # Tab 2 WebSocket (同じsession_id)
   session = await session_service.get_session(app_name, user_id, session_id)
   # ↑ 同じSessionインスタンスを取得！
   ```

2. **Concurrent run_live() Calls (並行実行)**
   ```python
   # Tab 1
   queue_1 = LiveRequestQueue()
   events_1 = runner.run_live(session=session, live_request_queue=queue_1)

   # Tab 2 (同じsession！)
   queue_2 = LiveRequestQueue()
   events_2 = runner.run_live(session=session, live_request_queue=queue_2)
   ```

3. **Result: Data Corruption (データ破損)**

**DeepWiki's Analysis:**

> "If `runner.run_live()` is called multiple times concurrently with the *same* session object, it will likely lead to unexpected behavior or race conditions. The `run_live` implementation modifies the session by appending events and managing the `InvocationContext`. Concurrent modifications to the same session object without proper synchronization mechanisms would result in data corruption or inconsistent state."

**Specific Issues:**

- Both calls operate on the **same Session object**
- Each has distinct `InvocationContext` but shared `Session` state
- `session.events` are modified concurrently without synchronization
- Session state becomes corrupted

**Conclusion:**
- ❌ **ADK does NOT support multiple concurrent connections with same session_id**
- ❌ **bidi-demo is designed for 1 connection = 1 session**
- ⚠️ **Multi-tab/multi-device with shared session is NOT supported**

---

### Critical Insight: The True Meaning of "Unique Session Per Client"

**Discussion #2784 Statement:**
> "Each client connection should map to a unique session identified by `userID`"

**True Meaning (Now Clear):**

**Option A (CORRECT):** Different `session_id` per connection
```
User Alice
├─ PC (connection_1) → session_id_1 → Independent conversation
├─ iPhone (connection_2) → session_id_2 → Independent conversation
└─ Android (connection_3) → session_id_3 → Independent conversation

Each device = Different session = NO shared conversation history
```

**Option B (INCORRECT):** Same session, route via `client_id` in state
```
User Alice → session_id_alice → Shared conversation
├─ PC (connection_1) → state['client_id'] = "conn_1"
├─ iPhone (connection_2) → state['client_id'] = "conn_2"
└─ Android (connection_3) → state['client_id'] = "conn_3"

This DOES NOT WORK due to race conditions in run_live()!
```

### New Understanding: ADK's Design Assumptions

**ADK bidi-streaming is designed for:**
- 1 user session = 1 active connection
- 1 device = 1 session
- No shared conversation history across devices/tabs

**ADK bidi-streaming is NOT designed for:**
- Multiple concurrent connections to same session
- Shared conversation history across devices
- Multi-tab coordination with same session

### Architectural Implications for Our Implementation

**Our Current Problem:**
```python
# server.py - Current implementation
user_id = "live_user"
session_id = f"session_{user_id}_{app_name}"
# → Same session_id for all connections from same user!
# → NOT compatible with ADK's design
```

**Two Design Options:**

#### Option 1: Follow ADK Pattern (Connection = Session)

```python
# Generate unique session_id per connection
connection_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
session_id = f"session_{user_id}_{connection_id}"

# Each tab/device gets independent session
# ✅ No race conditions
# ❌ No shared conversation history across devices
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Aligns with ADK's design
- ✅ No race conditions
- ✅ Simple and robust
- ✅ Each connection fully isolated

**Cons:**
- ❌ User loses conversation history when switching tabs/devices
- ❌ Cannot continue same conversation from different device
- ❌ Poor multi-device user experience

#### Option 2: Custom Session Management (Shared Conversation)

**Goal:** Allow multiple devices to share conversation history

**Challenges:**
- Need to synchronize session access across connections
- Need custom locking mechanism for Session object
- Need to route tool calls to specific connection
- Requires significant ADK modification

**Implementation Complexity:**
- 🔴 High complexity
- 🔴 Requires deep ADK internals understanding
- 🔴 May break with ADK updates
- ⚠️ Not officially supported by ADK

### The Remaining Question

**For our use case, which is more important?**

1. **Session Continuity Across Devices**
   - User can continue same conversation from PC, iPhone, Android
   - Requires Option 2 (custom session management)
   - High implementation cost

2. **Stable, Simple Implementation**
   - Follow ADK's design (Option 1)
   - Each connection = independent session
   - User gets fresh session on new tab/device

**This is a product/UX decision, not just a technical one.**

## Final Design Decision

**Date:** 2025-12-13

After thorough investigation and discussion, we have reached the final design decision.

### Design Decisions

#### Decision 1: Follow ADK Discussion #2784 Pattern

**✅ Adopted:** Use `tool_context.state` to access connection-specific resources

**Rationale:**
- Official ADK recommendation from Discussion #2784
- Aligns with ADK's design philosophy
- Simpler than closure pattern

**Key Pattern:**
```python
# Store delegate in session state
session.state['temp:delegate'] = connection_delegate

# Access in tool
@tool
async def change_bgm(track: int, tool_context: ToolContext):
    delegate = tool_context.state.get('temp:delegate')
    result = await delegate.execute_on_frontend(...)
```

---

#### Decision 2: Avoid Race Conditions with Connection-Scoped Sessions

**✅ Adopted:** Each connection gets unique session_id

**Pattern:**
```python
connection_id = str(uuid.uuid4())  # UUID v4 for collision prevention
user_id = "alice"
session_id = f"session_{user_id}_{connection_id}"
```

**Result:**
- Each WebSocket connection = Independent session
- No concurrent `run_live()` calls on same session
- No race conditions

---

#### Decision 3: Naming Conventions (ADK Official Sample)

**Q1: session_id naming**
```python
session_id = f"session_{user_id}_{connection_id}"
# Simple concatenation with UUID v4
```

**Q2: client_identifier (follow ADK sample)**
```python
session.state['client_identifier'] = connection_id
# NOT 'client_id' - use full name as in ADK samples
```

**Q3: No Closure Pattern - Use tool_context.state**
- ❌ Rejected: Closure pattern with `build_connection_tools(delegate)`
- ✅ Adopted: `tool_context.state['temp:delegate']` pattern
- Rationale: Simpler, follows ADK recommendations, no per-connection Agent/Runner needed

---

### Final Architecture

**Per-Connection State:**
```python
# On WebSocket connection
connection_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
session_id = f"session_{user_id}_{connection_id}"
session = await create_session(user_id, session_id)

# Store connection-specific resources in session state
session.state['temp:delegate'] = FrontendToolDelegate()
session.state['client_identifier'] = connection_id

# Use GLOBAL agent/runner (no per-connection creation)
bidi_agent_runner.run_live(session=session, ...)
```

**Tool Implementation:**
```python
@tool
async def change_bgm(track: int, tool_context: ToolContext):
    # Access connection-specific delegate
    delegate = tool_context.state.get('temp:delegate')
    client_id = tool_context.state.get('client_identifier')

    if not delegate:
        return {"success": False, "error": "Delegate not initialized"}

    logger.info(f"[change_bgm] client={client_id}")
    result = await delegate.execute_on_frontend(...)
    return result
```

---

### Benefits of This Design

1. ✅ **ADK Official Pattern** - Follows Discussion #2784 recommendations
2. ✅ **No Race Conditions** - Each connection = independent session
3. ✅ **Simpler Implementation** - No closure pattern, no per-connection Agent/Runner
4. ✅ **Global Agent Reuse** - Use existing `bidi_agent` and `bidi_agent_runner`
5. ✅ **Standard Naming** - `client_identifier` as in ADK samples
6. ✅ **Collision Prevention** - UUID v4 for connection_id
7. ✅ **Pythonic** - `temp:` state allows storing Python objects directly

---

### Implementation Plan (TDD)

---

#### ✅ Phase 1: Update get_or_create_session() [COMPLETED]

**Status:** ✅ Complete (2025-12-13)

**Changes Made:**

1. **Renamed parameter:** `connection_id` → `connection_signature`
   - Emphasizes this is not an operational ID but a unique identifier

2. **Updated function signature:**
   ```python
   async def get_or_create_session(
       user_id: str,
       agent_runner: InMemoryRunner,
       app_name: str = "agents",
       connection_signature: str | None = None,  # NEW PARAMETER
   ) -> Any:
   ```

3. **Session ID generation logic:**
   ```python
   if connection_signature:
       # Each WebSocket connection gets unique session to prevent race conditions
       session_id = f"session_{user_id}_{connection_signature}"
   else:
       # Traditional session for SSE mode (one session per user+app)
       session_id = f"session_{user_id}_{app_name}"
   ```

4. **Added comprehensive documentation:**
   - ADK Design Note explaining session = connection
   - Reference to Discussion #2784
   - Usage examples for SSE and WebSocket modes

**Tests Created:**
- `tests/unit/test_session_management.py`
  - ✅ `test_get_or_create_session_without_connection_id()` - Backward compatibility
  - ✅ `test_get_or_create_session_with_connection_signature()` - Connection-specific session
  - ✅ `test_get_or_create_session_reuses_existing_session()` - Session caching
  - ✅ `test_get_or_create_session_different_connections_get_different_sessions()` - Isolation

**Test Results:**
- 4/4 new tests passing
- 115/115 total tests passing
- No regressions

**Files Modified:**
- `server.py`: Updated `get_or_create_session()` function
- `tests/unit/test_session_management.py`: Created new test file

---

#### ⏭️ Phase 2: WebSocket Connection Setup

**Goal:** Initialize per-connection state when WebSocket connects.

**Location:** `server.py` - `websocket_endpoint()` function (around line 667)

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1. **Generate connection_signature on WebSocket accept:**
   ```python
   import uuid

   @app.websocket("/api/chat/bidi")
   async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
       await websocket.accept()

       # Generate unique connection signature (UUID v4 prevents collisions)
       connection_signature = str(uuid.uuid4())
       logger.info(f"[BIDI] New connection: {connection_signature}")
   ```

2. **Create connection-specific session:**
   ```python
   # Create session with connection_signature
   user_id = "live_user"  # TODO: Get from auth/JWT token
   session = await get_or_create_session(
       user_id,
       bidi_agent_runner,
       "agents",
       connection_signature=connection_signature  # KEY CHANGE
   )
   logger.info(f"[BIDI] Session created: {session.id}")
   ```

3. **Create connection-specific FrontendToolDelegate:**
   ```python
   from tool_delegate import FrontendToolDelegate

   # Create delegate for this specific connection
   connection_delegate = FrontendToolDelegate()
   logger.info(f"[BIDI] Created FrontendToolDelegate for connection: {connection_signature}")
   ```

4. **Store delegate and client_identifier in session.state:**
   ```python
   # Store in temp: state (not persisted, session-lifetime only)
   session.state['temp:delegate'] = connection_delegate
   session.state['client_identifier'] = connection_signature

   logger.info(
       f"[BIDI] Stored delegate and client_identifier in session state "
       f"(session_id={session.id})"
   )
   ```

5. **Uncomment process_tool_use_parts() call:**
   ```python
   # Currently commented (line 811-813):
   # TODO: Phase 2 - Implement per-connection delegate
   # from tool_delegate import process_tool_use_parts
   # process_tool_use_parts(last_msg, connection_delegate)

   # CHANGE TO:
   from tool_delegate import process_tool_use_parts
   process_tool_use_parts(last_msg, connection_delegate)
   ```

**Expected Changes:**
- Each WebSocket connection creates unique session
- Delegate stored in `session.state['temp:delegate']`
- `client_identifier` available for logging/debugging

**Test Plan (Manual):**
1. Open single tab → Verify session created with connection_signature
2. Open second tab → Verify different session created
3. Check logs → Both sessions have different IDs
4. Both tabs should work independently

**Files to Modify:**
- `server.py`: `websocket_endpoint()` function

---

#### ⏭️ Phase 3: Update Tools to Use tool_context.state

**Goal:** Update `change_bgm()` and `get_location()` tools to access delegate via `tool_context.state`.

**Location:** `server.py` - Tool definitions (around line 222-254)

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1. **Update change_bgm() tool:**

   **Current Implementation (Global Delegate):**
   ```python
   async def change_bgm(track: int, tool_context: ToolContext) -> dict[str, Any]:
       """Change background music track."""
       tool_call_id = tool_context.function_call_id
       if not tool_call_id:
           return {"success": False, "error": "Missing function_call_id"}

       # Uses GLOBAL frontend_delegate (PROBLEM!)
       result = await frontend_delegate.execute_on_frontend(
           tool_call_id=tool_call_id,
           tool_name="change_bgm",
           args={"track": track}
       )
       return result
   ```

   **New Implementation (Connection-Specific Delegate):**
   ```python
   async def change_bgm(track: int, tool_context: ToolContext) -> dict[str, Any]:
       """
       Change background music track (executed on frontend via browser AudioContext API).

       This tool requires user approval before execution and delegates actual
       execution to the frontend browser.

       Args:
           track: Track number (0 or 1)
           tool_context: ADK ToolContext (automatically injected)

       Returns:
           Result of BGM change operation from frontend
       """
       # Access connection-specific delegate from session state
       delegate = tool_context.state.get('temp:delegate')
       client_id = tool_context.state.get('client_identifier')

       # Error handling: Delegate not initialized
       if not delegate:
           error_msg = "Delegate not initialized in session state"
           logger.error(f"[change_bgm] {error_msg}")
           return {"success": False, "error": error_msg}

       # Get tool_call_id from ToolContext
       tool_call_id = tool_context.function_call_id
       if not tool_call_id:
           error_msg = "Missing function_call_id in ToolContext"
           logger.error(f"[change_bgm] {error_msg}")
           return {"success": False, "error": error_msg}

       logger.info(
           f"[change_bgm] client={client_id}, tool_call_id={tool_call_id}, track={track}"
       )

       # Delegate execution to frontend and await result
       result = await delegate.execute_on_frontend(
           tool_call_id=tool_call_id,
           tool_name="change_bgm",
           args={"track": track}
       )

       logger.info(f"[change_bgm] client={client_id}, result={result}")
       return result
   ```

2. **Update get_location() tool:**

   **Apply same pattern:**
   ```python
   async def get_location(tool_context: ToolContext) -> dict[str, Any]:
       """
       Get user's current location (executed on frontend via browser Geolocation API).

       This tool requires user approval before execution due to privacy sensitivity
       and delegates actual execution to the frontend browser.

       Args:
           tool_context: ADK ToolContext (automatically injected)

       Returns:
           User's location information from browser Geolocation API

3. **Optional: Deprecate global frontend_delegate:**
   ```python
   # Global frontend delegate instance (DEPRECATED)
   # Note: This global instance is kept for backward compatibility but should not be used.
   # WebSocket BIDI mode uses per-connection delegates via tool_context.state['temp:delegate']
   # Reference: experiments/2025-12-13_per_connection_state_management_investigation.md
   frontend_delegate = FrontendToolDelegate()
   ```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Access delegate via `tool_context.state.get('temp:delegate')`
- ✅ Access client_identifier via `tool_context.state.get('client_identifier')`
- ✅ Add error handling for missing delegate
- ✅ Add logging with client_id for debugging

**Testing:**
- Existing integration tests should continue to pass
- `tests/integration/test_stream_protocol_tool_approval.py` - 5 tests
- `tests/integration/test_backend_tool_approval.py` - Tests

**Files to Modify:**
- `server.py`: `change_bgm()` and `get_location()` tool definitions

#### ⏭️ Phase 4: Integration Testing

**Goal:** Verify multi-connection scenarios work correctly.

**Test Scenarios:**

1. **Single Connection (Baseline):**
   ```bash
   # Start server
   just dev

   # Open http://localhost:3000
   # Switch to BIDI mode
   # Send message: "Change BGM to track 1"
   # Verify: Tool approval request appears
   # Approve → Verify: Tool executes successfully
   ```

2. **Multi-Tab Scenario:**
   ```bash
   # Tab 1: Send message "Change BGM to track 0"
   # Tab 2: Send message "Change BGM to track 1"

   # Expected:
   # - Tab 1 receives approval request for track 0 only
   # - Tab 2 receives approval request for track 1 only
   # - No cross-tab interference
   ```

3. **Session Isolation:**
   ```bash
   # Tab 1: Check browser console → Note session_id
   # Tab 2: Check browser console → Note session_id

   # Expected:
   # - Different session_ids (both contain different connection_signatures)
   # - Both sessions work independently
   ```

4. **Concurrent Tool Calls:**
   ```bash
   # Tab 1: Send "Change BGM to track 0" (DO NOT approve yet)
   # Tab 2: Send "What's my location?" (DO NOT approve yet)

   # Expected:
   # - Tab 1 shows BGM approval request
   # - Tab 2 shows location approval request
   # - Approve Tab 1 → Only Tab 1's tool executes
   # - Approve Tab 2 → Only Tab 2's tool executes
   ```

**Automated Test Plan:**

Create `tests/integration/test_connection_isolation.py`:

```python
"""
Integration tests for connection-specific session management.

Verifies that multiple WebSocket connections get isolated sessions
and tool approval routing works correctly.
"""

import asyncio

from tool_delegate import FrontendToolDelegate

    """
    Should create separate sessions for different connections.

    This is the foundation for connection isolation.

    mock_tool_context.function_call_id = "call_abc123"

    # when: Tool accesses delegate (simulate tool implementation)

    )

    # then: Delegate called successfully
    assert result["success"] is True
    mock_delegate.execute_on_frontend.assert_called_once()
```

**Log Verification:**

Check logs for proper connection tracking:
```
[BIDI] New connection: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc
[BIDI] Session created: session_live_user_12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc
[BIDI] Created FrontendToolDelegate for connection: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc
[BIDI] Stored delegate and client_identifier in session state (session_id=session_live_user_12345678...)
[change_bgm] client=12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc, tool_call_id=call_xyz789, track=1
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Each WebSocket connection gets unique session_id
- ✅ Tool approval requests route to correct tab
- ✅ No cross-tab interference
- ✅ Logs show correct client_identifier
- ✅ All existing tests pass (no regressions)

**Files to Create:**
- `tests/integration/test_connection_isolation.py` (optional but recommended)

### Status Summary

| Phase | Status | Files Modified | Tests |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Phase 1 | ✅ Complete | `server.py`, `test_session_management.py` | 4/4 passing |
| Phase 2 | ⏭️ Ready | `server.py` (WebSocket endpoint) | Manual testing |
| Phase 3 | ⏭️ Ready | `server.py` (Tools) | Existing tests should pass |
| Phase 4 | ⏭️ Ready | `test_connection_isolation.py` (new) | TBD |

---

### Trade-offs Accepted

**✅ Supported:**
- Tool approval routing to source connection
- Concurrent tool approvals from multiple tabs
- Complete connection isolation

**❌ Not Supported (by design):**
- Conversation continuity across tabs/devices
- Device switching with conversation handoff
- Remote device tool execution (requires shared session)

**Rationale:** These unsupported features would require concurrent `run_live()` on same session, which ADK explicitly warns against (race conditions).

---

### Status

- ✅ Investigation complete
- ✅ Design decisions finalized
- ✅ Architecture documented
- ⏭️ Ready for implementation (TDD approach)
